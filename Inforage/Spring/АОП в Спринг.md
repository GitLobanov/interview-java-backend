Aspect-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While OOP is concerned with organizing code into classes and objects, AOP focuses on cross-cutting concerns – functionalities that affect multiple parts of an application. Cross-cutting concerns include logging, security, transactions, and more.

In runtime, Spring analyzes the crosscutting concerns defined for the beans in _ApplicationContext_ and generates proxy beans (which wrap the underlying target bean) dynamically. Instead of accessing the target bean directly, callers are injected with the proxied bean.

Remember that **Spring AOP has some limitations**. Such as:

- Final classes or methods cannot be proxied since they cannot be extended.
- Also, due to the proxy implementation, Spring AOP only applies to public, nonstatic methods on Spring Beans.
- If there is an internal method call from one method to another within the same class, the advice will never be executed for the internal method call.

## What is Advice, Joinpoint and Pointcut?

- **Joinpoint**: is a point of execution of the program, such as executing a method or handling an exception. **In Spring AOP, a joinpoint always represents a method execution.** Joinpoints define the points in your application at which you can insert additional logic using AOP.
- **Advice**: is the code that is executed at a particular joinpoint. There are many types of advice, such as _before_, which executes before the joinpoint, and _after_, which executes after it.
- **Aspect**: is the combination of advices and pointcuts encapsulated in a class.
- **Pointcut**: is a predicate or expression that matches joinpoints.
- **Weaving**: is the process of inserting aspects into the application code at the appropriate point. AspectJ supports a weaving mechanism called _loadtime weaving (LTW)_, in which it intercepts the underlying JVM class loader and provides weaving to the bytecode when it is being loaded by the class loader.
- **Target**: is the object whose execution flow is modified by an AOP process. Often you see the target object referred to as the _advised object_.
- Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language by default.

## Types of Advice in Spring AOP

There are five types of advice in Spring AOP.

- **Before advice**: Advice that executes before a join point, but which does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an exception).
- **After returning advice**: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally: for example, if a method returns without throwing an exception.
- **After throwing advice**: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception.
- **After advice**: Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a join point exits (normal or exceptional return).
- **Around advice:** Advice that surrounds a join point such as a method invocation. This is the most powerful kind of advice. Around advice can perform custom behavior before and after the method invocation. It is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own return value or throwing an exception.

Choosing an advice type is based on the requirements of the application, but we should choose the most specific advice type for our needs. Don’t use _around_ advice when _before_ advice will do.

In most cases, around advice can accomplish everything that the other three advice types can, but it may be overkill for what you are trying to achieve. By keeping the advice type as focused as possible, we reduce the scope for errors.

### Define an Advice using Aspect and Pointcut Expression

Each Aspect class should be annotated with **_@Aspect_** annotation. Within that class, we then specify Pointcuts and Advice. It should also be annotated with _@Component_ to be picked up by component scanning (or configured as a Spring bean in another way).

```java
@Aspect
public class EmployeeCRUDAspect {
      
    @Before("execution(* EmployeeManager.getEmployeeById(..))")     //point-cut expression
    public void logBeforeV1(JoinPoint joinPoint) {

        System.out.println("EmployeeCRUDAspect.logBeforeV1() : " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }
}
```

## Specifying Aspects Ordering

### Using the _@Order_ Annotation

One straightforward method to define the order of execution for aspects is by leveraging the _**[@Order](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html)**_ annotation. Aspects with lower order values are executed first.

- Aspects that have the same order value will be sorted with arbitrary ordering with respect to other objects with the same order value.
- Any aspect that does not provide its own order value is implicitly assigned a value of _Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE_, thus executed after all the ordered aspects have been executed.

Let’s consider two aspects, _MyAspect1_ and _MyAspect2_, where _MyAspect1_ should execute before _MyAspect2_.

```java
@Aspect
@Order(1)
@Component
public class MyAspect1 {
    // Executes first
}

@Aspect
@Order(2)
@Component
public class MyAspect2 {
    // Executes later
}
```

### Implementing the _Ordered_ Interface

Another approach to aspect ordering is by implementing the _**[Ordered](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html)**_ interface. This provides more control over the order values assigned to the aspects.

```java
import org.springframework.core.Ordered;

@Aspect
@Component
public class MyAspect1 implements Ordered {
    @Override
    public int getOrder() {
        return 1;
    }
    // Executes first
}

@Aspect
@Component
public class MyAspect2 implements Ordered {
    @Override
    public int getOrder() {
        return 2;
    }
    // Executes later
}
```

> Implementing _Ordered_ allows us to dynamically set the order value based on specific criteria or runtime conditions.

## Demo

For demo purposes, we are creating two aspects _LoggingAspect_ and _SecurityAspect_. We aim to execute _LoggingAspect_ before _SecurityAspect_.

Here the _@Order(1)_ annotation signifies that the logging aspect should be executed first.

```java
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
import org.springframework.core.annotation.Order;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@Aspect
@Order(1)
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggingAspect.class);

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore() {

        logger.info("LoggingAspect: Logging before method execution");
        // Logging logic
    }
}
```

The _@Order(2)_ annotation signifies that the security aspect should be executed second.

```java
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
import org.springframework.core.annotation.Order;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@Aspect
@Order(2)
@Component
public class SecurityAspect {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SecurityAspect.class);

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void checkSecurity() {

        logger.info("SecurityAspect: Performing security check before method execution");
        // Security check logic
    }
}
```

Now we can run the application and execute a method in any class in the ‘_com.howtodoinjava.service_‘ package. It will trigger both aspects in the desired order that we can validate from the logs.

```java
INFO  LoggingAspect: Logging before method execution
INFO  SecurityAspect: Performing security check before method execution
```

Great. Spring AOP aspects ordering is working as expected.

## Pointcut Expression Syntax

Spring AOP uses AspectJ-style expressions for defining pointcuts. The syntax involves combining various elements to precisely target specific join points.

For example, use `execution()` to specify the method execution join points. The basic syntax is in the pattern ‘_execution(modifiers? return_type method_name(param_type1, param_type2, …))_‘. Consider the following example:

```java
execution(public void com.example.service.MyService.doSomething())
```

Use wildcards to match multiple elements, similar to regular expressions. For instance, `*` matches any sequence of characters, and `..` matches any number of parameters. Consider the following example:

```java
execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))
```

Use `within()` to specify join points within a certain type or package. For example, the following expression matches all methods within the ‘_com.example.service_‘ package.

```java
within(com.example.service.*)
```

For more finer details on the syntax, continue reading. We will discuss a few most commonly used pointcut expressions.

## Pointcut Expressions: Matching Specific Methods in a Class

The most typical point-cut expressions are used to match the methods by their signatures. Let us see a few most commonly used patterns.

|Pointcut Expression|Description|
|---|---|
|execution(* com.example.EmployeeManager.*(..))|Match all methods in the specified package and class|
|execution(* EmployeeManager.*(..))|Match all methods in the same package and specified class|
|execution(public * EmployeeManager.*(..))|Match all public methods in _EmployeeManager_|
|execution(public Employee EmployeeManager.*(..))|Match all public methods in EmployeeManager with return type _Employee_ object|
|execution(public Employee EmployeeManager.*(Employee, ..))|Match all public methods in _EmployeeManager_ with return type _Employee_ and first parameter as _Employee_|
|execution(public Employee EmployeeManager.*(Employee, Integer))|Match all public methods in _EmployeeManager_ with return type _Employee_ and the specified parameters|

## Pointcut Expressions: Matching All Methods in a Class or Package

We can intercept the execution of all the methods in a class or package using the _within()_ function. Let us see a few most commonly used patterns.

|Pointcut Expression|Description|
|---|---|
|within(com.example.*)|Match all methods in all the classes inside package ‘_com.example.*_‘|
|within(com.example..*)|Match all methods in all the classes inside package ‘_com.howtodoinjava_‘ and the classes inside all sub-packages as well|
|within(com.example.EmployeeManagerl)|Match all methods within the specified class in the specified package|
|within(EmployeeManager)|Match all methods within the specified class in the current package|
|within(IEmployeeManager+)|Match all methods within all the implementations of the specified interface|

## Pointcut Expressions: Matching Class Name Patterns

We can use the _bean()_ function to match all the methods in all the classes that match the specified pattern.

|Pointcut Expression|Description|
|---|---|
|bean(*Manager)|Match all methods in bean whose name ends with ‘_Manager_‘|
|bean(employeeManager)|Match all methods in specified bean with name ‘_employeeManager_‘|
|bean(com.example.service.*)|Match all methods in all the beans in a specific Package|
|bean(@MyCustomAnnotation *)|Match all methods in all the beans with a specific annotation|

## Combining Pointcut Expressions

In AspectJ, pointcut expressions can be combined with the operators `&& (and)`, `|| (or)`, and `! (not)`.

Let us understand this with a simple example. The following matches all the methods in beans whose names ending with _Manager_ or _DAO_.

Use `'||'` sign to combine both expressions.

 ```java
 bean(*Manager) || bean(*DAO) 
```
