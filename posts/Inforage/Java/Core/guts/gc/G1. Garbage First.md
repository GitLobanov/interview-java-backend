G1 divides the java heap into multiple regions of equal size (Region), and the JVM can have up to 2048 Regions.  
Generally, the size of a Region is equal to the heap size divided by 2048. For example, if the heap size is 4096M, the size of the Region is 2M. Of course, you can also use the parameter "-XX:G1HeapRegionSize" to manually specify the region size, but the default calculation method is recommended.

G1 retains the concept of young generation and old generation, but is no longer a physical barrier. They are all (not continuous) collections of regions.

The default young generation heap memory percentage is 5%. If the heap memory size is 4096M, then the young generation occupies about 200M memory, corresponding to about 100 Regions. You can set the initial occupation of the new generation through "-XX:G1NewSizePercent" In contrast, during system operation, JVM will continue to add more Regions to the young generation, but at most the new generation will not account for more than 60%, which can be adjusted by "-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent". The regions corresponding to Eden and Survivor in the young generation are the same as before. The default is 8:1. Assuming that the young generation has 1000 regions, the eden region corresponds to 800, s0 corresponds to 100, and s1 corresponds to 100.

A Region may have been the young generation before, and if the Region is garbage collected, it may program the old generation again. In other words, the regional function of Region may change dynamically.

The G1 garbage collector will transfer to the old age when the object is god. The principle mentioned before is the same. The biggest difference is the processing of large objects. G1 has a Region that specifically allocates large objects called Humongous areas, instead of letting large objects directly proceed. In the region of the old age. In G1, the judgment rule for large objects is that a large object exceeds 50% of a Region. For example, according to the above calculation, each Region is 2M. As long as an object exceeds 1M, it will be put into Humongous, and one If the large object is too large, it may be stored across multiple regions. The Humongous area specializes in storing short-term giant objects without directly entering the old age, which can save space in the old age and avoid the GC overhead due to insufficient space in the old age. In Full GC, in addition to collecting the young and old generations, the homogous area will also be recycled.

The operation process of a GC of the G1 collector is roughly divided into the following steps:

- Initial mark  
    initial, STW, pause all other threads, and record the objects that gc roots can directly refer to, which is very fast.
- Concurrent marking: the same as CMS concurrent marking
- Final mark: Same as re-marking of CMS
- Screening marker  
    The screening recovery stage first sorts the recovery value and cost of each Region, and formulates the recovery plan according to the user's expected GC pause time (which can be specified by the JVM parameter: -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis). For example, in the old generation, 1,000 Regions are full at this time, but because of the expected pause time, this garbage collection may only pause for 200 milliseconds. Based on the previous recycling cost calculation, it may take just 200ms to recycle 800 of the regions. , Then only 800 Regions will be recovered, and try to keep the pause time caused by GC within the range we specify. In fact, this stage can also be executed concurrently with the user program. But because only part of the Region is recycled, the time is user-controllable, and stopping the user thread will greatly improve the collection efficiency. Regardless of whether the young generation is alive or in the old generation, the recycling algorithm is mainly a copy algorithm, which copies the objects that survive in one region to another region. This kind of recycling will not be like CMS because there are many memory fragments that need to be cleaned up. G1 uses a copy algorithm to reclaim hardly too many memory fragments.

The G1 collector maintains a priority list in the background. Each time according to the allowed collection time, the region with the highest recovery value is selected first (this is the origin of Garbage-First). For example, a region can collect 10M garbage in 200ms, and another region It takes 50ms to collect 20M garbage. In the case of limited collection time, G1 will of course choose this Region for recycling first. This use of Region to divide memory space and prioritized area recycling ensures that the G1 collector can collect as high as possible in a limited time.

It is regarded as an important evolutionary feature of the java virtual machine of JDK1.7 and above. It has the following characteristics:

- Parallel and concurrency: G1 can make full use of the hardware advantages of CPU and multi-core environments, and use multiple CPUs (CPU or CPU core) to shorten the stop-the-world pause time. Some other collectors originally need to pause the java thread to perform GC actions, but the G1 collector can still continue the execution of java programs in a concurrent manner.
- Banded collection: Although G1 can manage the entire GC heap without the cooperation of other collectors, it still retains the concept of generation.
- Spatial integration: Different from the “mark-and-sweep” algorithm of CMS, G1 is a collector implemented based on the “mark sorting” algorithm as a whole; from a partial point of view, it is implemented based on the “copy” algorithm.
- Predictable pause: This is another big advantage of G1 over CMS. Reducing the pause time is the common focus of G1 and CMS. However, in addition to pursuing low pause, G1 can also establish a predictable pause time model, which can be used The person clearly specifies a time segment of M milliseconds (specified by the parameter "-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis") to complete garbage collection.

G1 collector parameter settings  
-XX:+UseG1GC: Use G1 collector  
-XX:ParallelGCThreads: Specify the number of threads for GC work  
-XX:G1HeapRegionSize: Specify the partition size (1MB~32MB, and must be a power of 2), by default the whole heap is divided into 2048 partitions  
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis: target pause time (default 200ms)  
-XX:G1NewSizePercent: initial space of new generation memory (default whole heap 5%)  
-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent: Maximum space of new generation memory  
-XX: TargetSurvivorRatio: Filling capacity of Survivor area (default 50%), a batch of objects in Survivor area (age  
The sum of 1+age 2+age n multiple age objects) exceeds 50% of the Survivor area. At this time, all objects over age n (inclusive) will be placed in the old generation  
-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold: Maximum age threshold (default 15)  
-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent: The old generation occupies the entire heap memory threshold (45% by default), then a mixed collection (MixedGC) of the young generation and the old generation is performed. For example, the heap we said before has 2048 regions by default, if there are close to 1000 If a region is a region of the old generation, it may trigger MixedGC  
-XX:G1HeapWastePercent (default 5%): Whether the region vacated in the gc process is sufficient threshold, in the mixed recycling  
At that time, the region recovery is based on the replication algorithm. The surviving objects in the region to be recovered are placed in other regions, and then all the garbage objects in this region are cleaned up, so that they will be constantly vacated during the recovery process. new  
Region, once the number of free regions reaches 5% of the heap memory, the mixed collection will immediately stop, which means  
This mixed recycling is over.  
-XX: G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent (default 85%) Only when the live objects in the region are lower than this value will be recycled  
If the region exceeds this value, there are too many surviving objects, and the recovery is of little significance.  
-XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget: Specify how many screenings and collections should be done during a collection process (8 by default), in the last screening  
In the recovery phase, you can recover for a while, then suspend the recovery, resume system operation, and start the recovery again later, so that the system will not reach  
The single pause time is too long.

G1 garbage collection and classification  
YoungGC  
YoungGC does not mean that the existing Eden area will be triggered immediately when it is full, and G1 will calculate how long the current Eden area is reclaimed. If the reclaim time is much less than the value set by the parameter -XX:MaxGCPauseMills, then increase the young The region of the next generation will continue to store new objects and will not do Young GC immediately until the next time the Eden area is full, and the G1 calculation recovery time is close to the value set by the parameter -XX:MaxGCPauseMills, then Young GC will be triggered

MixedGC  
Not FullGC, when the heap occupancy rate of the old generation reaches the value set by the parameter (-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercen), it will be triggered, and all Young and some Old (determine the priority of garbage collection in the old area according to the expected GC pause time) and large objects In the normal situation, the garbage collection of G1 is mixedGC first. The replication algorithm is mainly used. It is necessary to copy the surviving objects in each region to other regions. If there are not enough empty regions to carry the copied objects during the copy process, it will be Trigger a Full GC  
Full GC stops the system program, and then uses a single thread to mark, clean and compress, so that a batch of regions are free for download  
Once MixedGC is used, this process is very time-consuming.

G1 garbage collector optimization recommendations  
Assuming that the parameter -XX:MaxGCPauseMills is set to a large value, the system runs for a long time, and the young generation may occupy the heap  
60% of the memory, only then trigger the young generation gc.

Then there may be many surviving objects. At this time, the Survivor area cannot fit so many objects, and it will enter the old age. Or after your young generation gc, too many objects survived, causing the dynamic age determination rules to be triggered after entering the Survivor area, reaching 50% of the Survivor area, which will quickly cause some objects to enter the old age.

So the core here is to adjust the value of -XX:MaxGCPauseMills to ensure that his young generation gc is not too  
At the same time, it is necessary to consider how many surviving objects are after each gc to avoid too many surviving objects to quickly enter the old age and frequent touch  
Send mixed gc.

How to optimize JVM for systems with hundreds of thousands of concurrent per second

Kafka's similar support for high-concurrency messaging system is certainly not unfamiliar to everyone. For Kafka, it is normal to process tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of messages per second. Generally, large memory machines (such as 64G) are required to deploy Kafka. It is said that 30 or 40 GB of memory can be allocated to the young generation to support high concurrent processing. Here is a problem. We used to say that the young gc in the eden area is very fast. In this case, it is Will the implementation be fast? Obviously, it is impossible. Because the memory is too large, the processing still takes a lot of time. Assuming that the collection of 30 or 40 GB of memory may take a few seconds at the earliest, according to the concurrency of kafka, fill the eden area of ​​30 or 40 GB. Maybe it's only a minute or two, which means that every minute or two the entire system runs, it will be unable to process new messages due to the young gc stalling for a few seconds, which is obviously impossible. So how to optimize this situation, we can use the G1 collector, set -XX:MaxGCPauseMills to 50ms, assuming that 50ms can reclaim three to four G of memory, and then 50ms of stutter is actually completely acceptable, and the user has almost no perception. Then the entire system can process the business while collecting garbage at the same time that it is almost unaware of the freeze. G1 is inherently suitable for JVM operation of such large-memory machines, and can perfectly solve the problem of too long garbage collection time for large-memory machines.
